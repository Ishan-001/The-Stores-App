## Features
- Through our app, people can scroll through various stores available in their city/area, access the item list, and check whether the store is crowded or not. 
- This may save time and decrease the risk to enter a crowded place. 
- Customers can send a list of items to the store online for delivery or pickup, thus reducing crowd at the store.
- The store owner can choose whether or not to accept the request. Upon accepting, they can pack all the needed items, increasing their efficiency and reducing interaction between customer and user.
- Store owners can constantly update the stores peak times so as to avoid forming a crowd at the store.
