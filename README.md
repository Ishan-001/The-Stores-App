## Inspiration
The need for social distancing and reducing crowds in general has risen at an alarming rate, especially in smaller stores where the risk of Covid-19 or other disease transmissions are high due to their locations in residential areas. Even in a post-COVID-19 scenario, crowd-control at any store is vital to the success of the store. Moreover, there is a lot of time wasted in storing the list of items in your phone's notes or on paper and then reading it out at the store. This also increases physical interaction between the customer and the owner, and thus enhances the risk of transmission.

## Why StoreHopper?
Our app is an attempt at crowd-control in small and medium sized stores and making the process of buying essentials smoother and safer. The store owners can update item availability and peak times on our app. Additionally, we also aim at making this process of procuring essentials a time-efficient process by letting you send the shopkeepers the list of items you need along with a message. The shopkeeper can gather and pack the items you need and store it ready to move as you take your time to reach the store, collect it and pay for it.

## Features
- Through our app, people can scroll through various stores available in their city/area, access the item list, and check whether the store is crowded or not. 
- This may save time and decrease the risk to enter a crowded place. 
- Customers can send a list of items to the store online for delivery or pickup, thus reducing crowd at the store.
- The store owner can choose whether or not to accept the request. Upon accepting, they can pack all the needed items, increasing their efficiency and reducing interaction between customer and user.
- Store owners can constantly update the stores peak times so as to avoid forming a crowd at the store.
